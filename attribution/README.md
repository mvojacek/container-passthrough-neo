This project was initially based on [HeavenCube's fork of Container Passthrough](https://github.com/HeavenCube/Container-Passthrough),
which is a fork of the now unmaintained [Container Passthroughs by Techdoodle](https://github.com/techchrism/container-passthrough),
both published under the [MIT License](./Techdoodle_MIT_LICENSE.txt).

The original project was written in Java and built with Maven. This project was started from the ground up in Kotlin and
using Gradle, using only the main plugin source code as a working reference. This means the code is much cleaner and
maintainable now, and thanks to Kotlin's null safety, likely also more reliable.

Additionally, the project was expanded beyond the scope of the original project's capabilities,
adding configuration, support for 1.20 sign coloring and glowing, editing signs, waxing signs, and enderchests.
